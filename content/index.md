A website using Anax Flat
===============================

Hello,

This is my website for the design course.

I am excited to build this site, and see how beautiful design we can make.
This site is built with anax-flat cms.
My english isn't the best, but I want to write this site in english.

My name is Robin I live in Stockholm, I got intressted in programming
and especially into webdesign when I was studiyng at High School.
That was the first time I was introduced to webbdesign, programming with python and c++,
and I liked it alot!
